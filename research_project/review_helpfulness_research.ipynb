       "27882  neat little packages that make cyanoacrylate  ca so convenient to use the krazy brand  from my experience  seems to be very good compared to other brands and they have not gotten the  make me rich fever with a fair price so far i got some noname brands  too and i will try and keep track of how they compare to the krazy brand  i tape the little nozzle into a duct tape fold  tape around the end of the nozzle to seal the end from air you need to be able to pull on the ends of the tape and the nozzle will come free for the next job and the glue seems to  work well a month or 2 after it has been opened you just yank open the tape fold and the container is read to go for the next job  i find that i dont need too much quantity but just want it for those many little jobs around the house and garage if one is not careful you can pay too much for this stuff there is an adhesive company that goes around buying up others for a monopoly and the prices that they command are almost criminal hey it is the american dream give you nothing and charge super high prices   \n",
