       "      <td>i was undecided between the neato botvac d85 and this roomba 870 and had played with both for about a week prior to returning the neato i wont bash the neato in fact it was a close call since both are impressive robots and vacuum cleaners ultimately i chose the roomba based on three criteria  1 ability to clean both bots can clean and in all actuality the roomba only pulled out slightly ahead of the neato in terms of my nonscientific tests involving chex cereal and sugar tossed on the floor the roombas name is optimus grime by the way i read someplace that 70 of robot vacuum owners name their robots odd anyway it seems that the smaller the space the more roombas somewhat random method of traversing that space results in thoroughness and multiple passes it isnt entirely random while watching it clean it is clear in some cases that there is method to its madness im still constantly impressed by how much it picks up in terms of pure navigation the neato is more logical it fires up out of the gate spins its laser turret and maps the room in most cases its movements were very precise while threading around furniture but it often only did one pass if it didnt get something the first time well meh both were great at my typical messes cat fur litter scattered everyplace and dust bunnies i do like how the exhaust from the roomba pointed slightly upwards so as not to accidentally scatter debris around that it hasnt collected yet  2 perceived robustness irobot has been making robots since 2002 it also dabbles in military and police grade robots aside from making cute vacuums and autonomous pool cleaners it is my understanding i didnt check up on it that neato is a newer company and one that apparently has some kinks to work out neither machine is perfect but informal google searches show that roomba owners have been generally using their robots for years only needing standard maintenance neato owners have complained about glitchy software and flimsy plastic parts the week i had my d85 i received the infamous please clear my path error there was nothing in its way at all it also got fixated on a corner of my kitchen and just sort of spun around these things are pricey and although they ship with manufacturers warranties id prefer to let the product work as advertised and not hassling the company for technical assistance which leads me to  3 customer service every single email or live chat ive had with irobot customer service has resulted in a prompt reply that wasnt some boilerplate message i was concerned that my roomba was running into my black furniture fairly hard it has a tough time seeing black and contacted customer service to see if that was normal although it was they shipped me out a free set of bumper extenders that i can place on the roomba perfect solution nope but they tried and im sure the bumpers will help stave off potential damage now the three times i contacted neato i got nothing zip tumbleweeds were rolling across my screen i need to know that a company that is selling a complex and expensive product will be their to help with issues  in conclusion both devices have their merits and downfalls but neither is incompetent as a robot or a vacuum they both have different means as to how they go about their duties i really had to take time and think about which would stay home and which would be returned im happy with my optimus grime but im sure either device would be helpful in your home</td>\n",

       "21758  i was undecided between the neato botvac d85 and this roomba 870 and had played with both for about a week prior to returning the neato i wont bash the neato in fact it was a close call since both are impressive robots and vacuum cleaners ultimately i chose the roomba based on three criteria  1 ability to clean both bots can clean and in all actuality the roomba only pulled out slightly ahead of the neato in terms of my nonscientific tests involving chex cereal and sugar tossed on the floor the roombas name is optimus grime by the way i read someplace that 70 of robot vacuum owners name their robots odd anyway it seems that the smaller the space the more roombas somewhat random method of traversing that space results in thoroughness and multiple passes it isnt entirely random while watching it clean it is clear in some cases that there is method to its madness im still constantly impressed by how much it picks up in terms of pure navigation the neato is more logical it fires up out of the gate spins its laser turret and maps the room in most cases its movements were very precise while threading around furniture but it often only did one pass if it didnt get something the first time well meh both were great at my typical messes cat fur litter scattered everyplace and dust bunnies i do like how the exhaust from the roomba pointed slightly upwards so as not to accidentally scatter debris around that it hasnt collected yet  2 perceived robustness irobot has been making robots since 2002 it also dabbles in military and police grade robots aside from making cute vacuums and autonomous pool cleaners it is my understanding i didnt check up on it that neato is a newer company and one that apparently has some kinks to work out neither machine is perfect but informal google searches show that roomba owners have been generally using their robots for years only needing standard maintenance neato owners have complained about glitchy software and flimsy plastic parts the week i had my d85 i received the infamous please clear my path error there was nothing in its way at all it also got fixated on a corner of my kitchen and just sort of spun around these things are pricey and although they ship with manufacturers warranties id prefer to let the product work as advertised and not hassling the company for technical assistance which leads me to  3 customer service every single email or live chat ive had with irobot customer service has resulted in a prompt reply that wasnt some boilerplate message i was concerned that my roomba was running into my black furniture fairly hard it has a tough time seeing black and contacted customer service to see if that was normal although it was they shipped me out a free set of bumper extenders that i can place on the roomba perfect solution nope but they tried and im sure the bumpers will help stave off potential damage now the three times i contacted neato i got nothing zip tumbleweeds were rolling across my screen i need to know that a company that is selling a complex and expensive product will be their to help with issues  in conclusion both devices have their merits and downfalls but neither is incompetent as a robot or a vacuum they both have different means as to how they go about their duties i really had to take time and think about which would stay home and which would be returned im happy with my optimus grime but im sure either device would be helpful in your home   \n",
