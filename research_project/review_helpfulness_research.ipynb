       "36255  the outside dimensions and design of this line splitter are fine both of my clamp on ammeters fit the 1x and 10x holes well and the voltage meter probe holes are handy but i immediately noticed that  when plugging into the female end the plugs tended to spring back out  this was especially true for two blade plugs  something was obviously wrong with the female receptacle contacts so i took the device apart to investigate sure enough the blade contacts were so far recessed into the housing that the plug blades barely made contact  the internal shape of the plastic housing suggests that it was designed for longer blade contacts but short ones were used instead also one power wire was not soldered to the blade contact as were the other wires the unsoldered wire was simply pushed through a hole in the contact but someone forgot to solder it i modified the blade contacts so that plug blades would make good contact and i soldered the loose wire still however the female plug receptacle contacts are weak and will eventually break if this device is used often to address that problem i plugged a multiplug adapter into the female end  and i plan to tape or glue the adapter into place  that way the units internal weak blade contacts will not repeatedly be stressed by inserting plugs directly into the unit  also the stiff solid wire inside is soldered to one of the plug receptacle flexible contacts that joint is bound to eventually break as the receptacle flexes how this device qualified for a ul listing ill never know but having spent about two hours modifying it  i do plan to keep it  and use it when needed   the kill a watt power meters also sold by amazon  are a better bet for most uses and far more versatile   \n",
